maximum 3 moving bugs per screen. and maximum 3 falling pots

one pot falls in 64 frames through 104 pixels, and it explodes for 8
it has "SOME" kind of acceleration but only for the first frames.

Spiders:
The positioning speed is constant (?), the climbing speed changes with level. find the formula


The slowest speed for spiders is 160 frames to cover their vertical distance. Which is 104 pixel on the commodore
so we start with speed = 



bugs:

player should always move,even through cutscenes
player position does not reset at level start

there are still char artifacts when building collapses.
